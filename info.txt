In the game you use gems for various effects.
Gems can be used from the menu and their effects vary form dealing damage
allowing you going several turns in a row.

The status effects that gems can apply:
Burning:        Take damage at the beggining of each turn
Frozen:         Skip a turn
Protected:      Protect from taking damage
Regenerating:   Heal hp at the beggining of each turn
Cursed:         Take damage instead of healing
Hasted:         Next turn will be yours again

Enemies
In the game enemies are based on gems as well and their powers can have effects
of various gems. For example:
Emeraldia has the power of Emerald and can heal allies
Amerub is a fusion of Amethyst and Ruby and can apply protected and burning effects

Rooms
Rooms have enemies and you chose which room to enter at each level.
Completing one room per level is enough to pregress further.
When you clear a room from enemies you get rewards and healing.
